# Using Scripts

These steps work fine on both Firefox and [Chromium Based Browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)#Browsers_based_on_Chromium).

1. Open the feedback form (`Academic` > `Feedback form`) in ERP.
2. Click on the subject code and the professor button.
3. Open console in your browser:
   - Press``F12`` for firefox
   - Press ``Ctrl + Shift + J`` for Chrome.
4. Copy the code from your desired variant of `*_feedback.js` and paste in that console window and click `Run`.
5. All fields would be filled by now.
6. Fill up the captcha and submit.
    
> [!Note]
>  Firefox shows scam warning on copy pasting commands into the console!
> 
> To enable copy pasting commands, simply run the command `allow pasting` in your console.
